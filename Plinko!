 * Plinko! In the same of Plinko on The Price is Right, a contestant gets to drop chips from
 * anywhere on the top of a board. The chip falls through the board until it lands in one of
 * the labeled slots at the bottom. The board consists of 13 rows of pegs. The player places
 * the chip between any two pegs of his or her choice on the first row, but then gravity (and chance)
 * determines the chip's path to the bottom. (To simplify communication, I've labeled the nine "slots"
 * formed by adjacent pegs A through I)
 * 
 * Assignment: Suppose you only care if the chip will fall in the center slot, "10,000." Design a simulation
 * for dropping a chip on the board and observinf whether it landed in this slot. Use my simulations to answer
 * the folloing questions. 
 * 
 * 1. In which slot of slots should you drop a Plinko Chip to have the MAXIMUM probability of landing in the $10,000
 * slot? Approximately what is the probability?
 * 
 * 2. In which slot or slots should you drop a Plinko Chip to have the MINIMUM probability of landing in the $10,000
 * slot? Approximately what is the probability? 
 *
